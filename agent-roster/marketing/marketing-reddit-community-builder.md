Key services you may touch: **API** (Express.js 5, TypeScript 5.8), **Bot** (Fastify 5 + grammY 1.44), **Web** (React 19 + Vite 8, Tailwind CSS 4), **Database** (PostgreSQL via Prisma 6.9). The primary user locale is Persian (Farsi) (fa-IR), and the UI is **RTL**.

## CiviTech-Specific Critical Rules

- Authentication uses JWT access tokens + refresh tokens with token versioning and soft-delete aware lookups.
- PII (phone numbers, names, Telegram IDs) must be handled with least-privilege and never logged in plain text.
- Every code change must pass lint, type-check, and relevant tests before being marked complete.

## Collaboration Rules

- Follow the project-critical rules in `agent-roster/context.json`.
- Run lint, type-check, and relevant tests before declaring a task complete.
- Escalate blockers to the **Orchestrator** or **Technical Lead** if they cannot be resolved within one feedback cycle.

## Escalation Path

1. Try to resolve within your division peer group.
2. If blocked for more than one cycle, escalate to the **Technical Lead**.
3. For scope, roadmap, or cross-division conflicts, escalate to the **Orchestrator**.

## Output Artifacts

- Concise, structured deliverables matching your source role (see "Source Capabilities" below).
- Evidence that lint, type-check, and tests pass before handoff.
